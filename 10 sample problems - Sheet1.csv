"Let $n$ beads be arranged on a circle and indexed $0,1,\dots,n-1$. Each bead is colored by an element of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_7=\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z}$. Two colorings $(c_0,\dots,c_{n-1})\in \mathbb{F}_7^n$ are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or reflection of the necklace (i.e.\ by the usual dihedral action $D_n$ on indices).
A coloring is \emph{admissible} if it satisfies all three linear constraints in $\mathbb{F}_7$:
\text{(C0)}\ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \equiv 0,\qquad
\text{(C1)}\ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i\,c_i \equiv 0,\qquad
\text{(C2)}\ \sum_{\substack{0\le i\le n-1\\ i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 3)}} c_i \equiv 1.
For this problem, take $n=30$.
 How many $D_n$–equivalence classes of admissible colorings are there for $n=30$? Report your answer modulo $1{,}000{,}003$ as a positive integer.",587104
"Let $H$ be the set of all hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^{48}$ given by 
$x_i - x_j = 0$ or $x_i - x_j = 1$ 
for every pair of indices with $1 \le i < j \le 48$.  
Intersect $H$ with the hyperplane 
$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{48} = 0$ 
to obtain an arrangement inside that $47$-dimensional subspace.  
Let $r$ be the number of regions of this arrangement, and let $b$ be the number of relatively bounded regions.  
What is the remainder of $(r - b)$ when divided by $48$?",2

"Consider a multi-agent epistemic model with three agents $A,B,C$ operating in the multi-agent logic $\mathsf{S5}$.  
The set of possible worlds is $W=\mathbb{F}_2^{12}$, the set of all 12-bit binary strings 
$x=(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{12})$ with arithmetic modulo 2 (XOR).  
The designated actual world is $w_\star=0$ (the all-zeros string). Each agent $i$ has an equivalence relation $R_i$ on $W$ representing indistinguishability.  
We define these via linear subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^{12}$:
 \textbf{Agent A:} Let $U_A=\mathrm{span}\{e_1,e_2\}$ where $e_j$ is the $j$th standard basis vector.  
Define $x\,R_A\,y$ iff $x-y\in U_A$ (equivalently, $x$ and $y$ differ only in coordinates 1 and 2).
 \textbf{Agent B:} Let $U_B=\mathrm{span}\{e_3,e_4\}$.  
Define $x\,R_B\,y$ iff $x-y\in U_B$.
 \textbf{Agent C:} Let $U_C=\mathrm{span}\{e_1+e_3,\,e_2+e_4\}$.  
Define $x\,R_C\,y$ iff $x-y\in U_C$.
\textbf{Epistemic operators.}  
Write $K_i\varphi$ for “agent $i$ knows $\varphi$,” 
$EG\varphi := K_A\varphi \wedge K_B\varphi \wedge K_C\varphi$ for “everyone knows $\varphi$,” 
and $CG\varphi$ for “common knowledge of $\varphi$ among $G=\{A,B,C\}$.”  
Common knowledge $CG\varphi$ holds at world $w$ iff $\varphi$ holds at every world reachable from $w$ 
by any finite sequence of steps along $R_A \cup R_B \cup R_C$.
\textbf{Component structure and tags.}  
Let $H=U_A+U_B+U_C$ (the subspace sum, computed with XOR addition).  
The connected components of the undirected graph with edge set $R_A\cup R_B\cup R_C$ 
are precisely the cosets $x+H$ for $x\in\mathbb{F}_2^{12}$.  
For each component $X$, define its tag as the 8-bit integer formed by the last eight coordinates of any world in $X$:
\mathrm{tag}(X) := \text{binary value of } (x_5x_6x_7x_8x_9x_{10}x_{11}x_{12}) \in \{0,1,\dots,255\}.
This is well-defined since $H$ acts only on the first four coordinates.
We consider valuations $V$ assigning truth values to three propositional atoms $p,q,r$ at each world.  
A valuation is \emph{admissible} iff it satisfies two conditions:
\textbf{(F1)} At $w_\star$: $\mathcal{M},w_\star\models CG(EGp \wedge EG\neg q)$.
\textbf{(F2)} Among all components $X\ne X_\star$ (where $X_\star$ is the component containing $w_\star$),  
call $X$ \emph{good} if for any (equivalently, every) $x\in X$:
\mathcal{M},x\models CGEGr \quad\wedge\quad CGEG(p\leftrightarrow r\oplus \mathrm{parity}(\mathrm{tag}(X))),
where $\mathrm{parity}(t)$ is the sum of bits in the binary representation of $t$ modulo $2$, 
and $\oplus$ denotes XOR.  
Let $S=\{X\ne X_\star : X \text{ is good}\}$. Then,
|S|\equiv 7\pmod{13}, \qquad \sum_{X\in S}\mathrm{tag}(X)\equiv45\pmod{97}.
Count the number of admissible valuations. Report your answer modulo $10{,}007$.",4814
